# MiraData

------------

A suite of tools for generating high quality training and validation data for AI applications.

## Overview

![data generation diagram](images/diagram.png)

## Usage

### Requirements

* python 3.6

### Dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

------------

## DATA AUGMENTATION

### Identify Similar Columns

- For each column C, a set of columns identified which tend to confuse with the column C.

### Identify Representative Aliases 

- For each column C, find several 3-5 most represenative aliases. 

### Paraphrase (Backtranslation)

-

### Weak Supervision

-

### Contextual data augmentation

-

### RISD

- **Synonym Replacement (SR):** Randomly choose *n* words from the sentence that are not stop words. Replace each of these words with one of its synonyms chosen at random.
- **Random Insertion (RI):** Find a random synonym of a random word in the sentence that is not a stop word. Insert that synonym into a random position in the sentence. Do this *n* times.
- **Random Swap (RS):** Randomly choose two words in the sentence and swap their positions. Do this *n* times.
- **Random Deletion (RD):** For each word in the sentence, randomly remove it with probability *p*.
